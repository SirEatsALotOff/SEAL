# SEAL
Soon to be an incredibly useful batch tool created with hotkey expansion in mind. If you ever run out of extra keys, or don't have any at all, this program will be perfect.
FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO CONTRIBUTE, create your version as a seperate file, so I can load it in as the BETA MODE.
I haven't programmed seriously in batch in years, so I have to brush up on a lot of things. I plan on handling the macro handler next, but there will be no easy way to add macros. It will write a .SMAC file, with the trigger key being the title.
ex. "openchrome.smac"
Inside will be the instructions for the macro handler to deal with. For now I will try to make an easy to understand config inside the macro handler.
